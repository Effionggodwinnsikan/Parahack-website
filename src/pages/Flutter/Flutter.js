            Flutter has been around for a while since its public release in
            2017. Over the years, Flutter app development has entirely changed
            how cross-platform applications are developed. Android and iOS
            applications required a separate codebase and different development
            teams before the introduction of Flutter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, it’s common to see many flutter app development companies
            offering their services. If you’re considering it for your mobile
            app, you’re not the only one! Many business owners and companies
            have started using flutter app development services.

            Hopefully, this article will convince you if you’re on the fence
            about using Flutter app development and unsure if you should hire
            Flutter developers. Let’s begin!
          </p>
          <h3>What is Flutter?</h3>
          <p>
            Flutter is an open-source portable UI toolkit created by Google.
            It’s used to craft cross-platform applications for mobile, web, and
            desktop applications from a single codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flutter is primarily used for developing mobile apps. The main
            reason behind this is because Flutter allows you to program
            different apps for different mobile operating systems through a
            single codebase.{" "}
          </p>
          <h3>5 Key Benefits Of Flutter For Mobile App Development</h3>
          <p>
            The benefits of using Flutter for your next mobile app are endless.
            It’s safe to say that the pros outweigh the cons in most cases. Here
            are some of the key benefits:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Single Codebase (Cross-platform Programming)</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Before Flutter’s release, developers had a more challenging time
            crafting mobile applications. This is because they were required to
            write different codes for Android and iOS devices.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to Flutter’s code reusability, you can now write just one
            codebase and use it for all platforms. Yes, you heard it right — all
            platforms. You can use the single codebase you’ve written for
            Android & iOS devices, as well as for web, desktop, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of the single shared codebase, Flutter’s widgets make it even
            easier to use for several platforms. Not only does all of this cut
            costs, but it also allows you to launch your new mobile app much
            faster due to the drastically reduced development time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Cost-Effective</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When compared to other cross-platform app development frameworks,
            Flutter is a much cheaper alternative. This is partly because of
            Flutter’s cross-platform functionality, as mentioned above.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to go for a flutter app development service, you will
            likely save even more money. Outsourcing your mobile app development
            via an agency will ensure lesser development time, greater
            cost-effectiveness, and reduce your overall budget.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can hire a single Flutter development team for your mobile app
            and not worry about spending money on different development teams
            for other platforms.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>High Performance</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many app development frameworks commonly used for mobile app
            development are back-dated and not as efficient as Flutter.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, using Flutter, you are guaranteed to experience
            high application performance, which can compare to the native app.
            In specific scenarios, such as for complex UI animations, Flutter
            can outperform other app development frameworks.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Fast & Flexible Development</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Flutter is faster than most other application development frameworks
            available in the market. This is mainly due to some of its distinct
            features, such as:
          </p>
          <h5>Hot Reload</h5>
          <p>
            Hot reloading is generally used to keep an app running and to inject
            newer versions of edited files at runtime. Flutter’s hot reload is
            one of the primary reasons behind its faster app development time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, if you’re using other application development
            frameworks, you will write code and wait for it to compile and load
            on your device before seeing any changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Flutter’s hot reload feature, the effects are almost immediate.
            This means your development team can cooperate with others more
            effectively and make quick changes.
          </p>

          <h5>Widgets</h5>
          <p>
            One of the best features you’ll notice when using Flutter is its
            ready-to-use widgets. Some of these widgets are designed to simulate
            the behavior of other design languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Widgets play a significant role in Flutter’s cross-platform
            functionality. The reason why Flutter’s widgets are popular is
            because of how customizable and flexible they are. These widgets are
            suitable for pretty much any mobile application type.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the widgets allow flexible development. You can expect to
            create your mobile app how you like it using customized widgets.{" "}
          </p>
          <h5>Dart Language</h5>
          <p>
            Dart Language is a programming language implemented by Google to
            replace JavaScript. It is known for its speed and efficiency and is
            about 2x faster than JavaScript. It’s also very scalable across
            projects and more type-safe than JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have previous experience with Javascript, switching to Dart
            will be an easy process. Moreover, most programming errors are
            detected during the compilation because Dart is a compiled language.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Reliability</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Flutter, in a word, is reliable. Over the last five years, Flutter
            gained a vast number of followers. Thus there’s no shortage of
            flutter app development companies or services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many major companies and organizations have cross-platform
            applications built via Flutter. Some of these companies listed on
            Flutter’s official website are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>BMW</li>
            <li>Google Pay</li>
            <li>Alibaba Group</li>
            <li>Abbey Road Studios</li>
            <li>Beike</li>
            <li>CrowdSource</li>
            <li>ByteDance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            helped these corporate giants.

            Unsure if you should use Flutter stack for your next mobile project?
          </h3>
          <p>
            When choosing to go with either a native application or a
            cross-platform application using Flutter, it depends on the end goal
            of the application. Our experienced mobile application consultants
            can help determine this.

            In conclusion, I would urge all startups or established
            organizations to do the due diligence to ensure the agency that will
            be doing the development has the knowledge, skillsets, and expertise
            to get the project completed on time without sacrificing code
            quality. I often come across projects that are halfway done, using
            outdated tech stack where the client has spent a significant amount
            of resources to be in a position where the project can’t be
            finished. To learn more about our software development and staff
