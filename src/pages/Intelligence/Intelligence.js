            If you’re here, you must have heard of Power BI, and now you’re
            considering using it as your company’s business intelligence tool.
            Or perhaps you’d like to switch from your existing business
            intelligence tool to Power BI.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever the reason is, this blog should convince you why Power BI
            has become a must-have business intelligence tool and why it may be
            the best pick for you.
          </p>
          <p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
          <h4>What is Business Intelligence?</h4>
          <p>
            Business systems in every industry produce ranges of data of
            different sizes, such as terabytes, petabytes, or in some instances,
            exabytes. The data is analyzed and further used to create actionable
            information (decisions). This entire process is known as Business
            Intelligence (BI).{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            BI combines business analytics, data visualization, data tools and
            infrastructure, data mining, etc., to aid companies and
            organizations in making more data-driven decisions. BI-based
            decisions are essential to a company’s performance and success.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Your company can gain many benefits from business intelligence; some
            are:{" "}
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased organizational efficiency </li>
            <li>Data-driven decision making</li>
            <li>Improved customer experience</li>
            <li>Improved employee satisfaction</li>
            <li>Increased competitive advantage, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are currently several BI tool options with similar features;
            therefore, choosing the right BI software for your company can be
            time-consuming. Let’s move on to Power BI.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Power BI, And Why Use It?</h3>
          <p>
            Microsoft Power BI is a dedicated business intelligence platform
            that businesses can use to clean and transform data into meaningful
            data. It is commended worldwide for its ability to analyze data
            thoroughly and share powerful insights that increase company
            performance and overall success.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the Gartner Magic Quadrant positioned Microsoft in the
            leader’s quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms
            2018 edition. They also considered Power BI a go-to platform based
            on its vision of completeness and ability to execute business
            intelligence solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, Microsoft Power BI has evolved into an exceptional
            Business Intelligence and analytics tool which is very versatile yet
            easy to use. Because of the flexibility combined with usability,
            Power BI has become one of the go-to business intelligence platforms
            that companies of all sizes currently use.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are many reasons to use Power BI or switch to it from
            your previous BI tool, here are five key reasons to choose Power BI:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>It’s Beginner-Friendly</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Power BI is commonly known for having a very easy-to-use interface.
            In addition, it requires no programming experience to use, thus
            making it very beginner-friendly. Power BI’s inbuilt intelligence
            helps you select attributes for your reports by suggesting the best
            report elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Microsoft, Power BI scales to serve the needs of all
            its users, from business operations to IT, and includes both types
            of BI solutions.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The Self-service BI is appropriate for employees in any operational
            area, requires no technical skills for building analyses, features
            AI-assisted automation and insights, and has a user-friendly
            interface that features drag-and-drop, filtering, drill-downs, and
            computer fields.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Enterprise BI is commonly used by analytics teams for deeper
            data investigations. It features advanced administration and
            deployment controls and includes big data support and on-premises
            reporting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Power BI has been developed on the founding platform of
            Microsoft Excel. This globally recognized spreadsheet software is
            widely used and accepted — making Power BI easy to learn, especially
            if you have a good understanding of Excel. Microsoft Power BI also
            comes with guides of its own.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>It’s Cost-Efficient</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Power BI Desktop offers both free and paid license options. You can
            expect to develop accessible and complex reports and dashboards
            using the free Power Bi desktop app. However, the paid license
            options are excellent value for money and cost-efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pro license costs about USD 10 per month. In exchange, it
            provides many pro features such as dedicated servers, higher data
            set size, higher frequency of data refresh, and many other options.
            While the premium license is a capacity-based offering, enabling you
            to customize costing based on the capacity.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>It Allows Easy Collaboration</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Unlike other BI tools, Power BI allows easy collaboration with your
            co-workers. You must hold a Power BI Pro or Premium license to share
            your content. Via the Power BI workspaces, you can expect to
            collaborate to create meaningful reports and dashboards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, you can also share dashboards, reports, and scorecards
            from your personal workspace with another. There are many more
            collaborative features that come along with Power BI Pro/Premium.{" "}
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>It Covers A Wide Range of Data Sources</h4>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Power BI provides coverage for an extensive range of data sources.
            The team behind Power Bi continually expands data sources, and often
            you may even see early beta versions of such data sources on your
            application. As of now, Microsoft states that Power BI supports more
            than 160 types of data sources.
          </p>
          <p className={Classes.fStyle}>
            Note: Some of the data connectors for Power BI Desktop may require
            Internet Explorer 10 or newer to get authorized.
          </p>
          <p>
            As per Microsoft’s information, here are some of the following data
            connections provided by Power BI’s Database:

            In conclusion, I would urge all startups or established
            organizations to do the due diligence to ensure the agency
            responsible for the development has the required knowledge,
            skillsets, and expertise to get the project completed on time
            without sacrificing code quality. I often come across projects that
            are halfway done, using outdated tech stack where the client has
            spent a significant amount of resources to be in a position where
            the project can’t be finished. To learn more about our services,
